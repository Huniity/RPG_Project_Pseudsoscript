            Emerging from the Caverns of Time, the fierce champion of Stormwind felt a chill in the air. 
            Dark, corrupted whispers echoed in his mind, taunting him with the Lich King's sinister promise: 
                                    
                                    'You cannot escape your fate.'

            Determined to defy this darkness, he ventured toward Icecrown Citadel, a fortress of despair looming against the horizon. 
            Shadows loomed over the frozen landscape, and anguished cries echoed through the biting wind.

            As the shadows receded, he stood in the silence that followed, feeling the weight of his choices. 
            It was time for him to choose his path, knowing that the future of Azeroth rested in his hands.
